        <h2>The Evolution of Neural Networks</h2>
        
        <p>Modern object detection systems rely heavily on deep neural networks, which have evolved significantly over the past decade. Early approaches like R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) have given way to more sophisticated architectures such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>YOLO (You Only Look Once):</strong> A real-time object detection system that processes images in a single pass, dramatically improving processing speed.</li>
          <li><strong>EfficientDet:</strong> A scalable architecture that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Transformer-based models:</strong> Adapting the attention mechanisms that revolutionized NLP to visual tasks, enabling more contextual understanding of scenes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These architectural improvements have led to systems that can detect objects with greater accuracy, speed, and efficiency than ever before.</p>
        
        <h2>Real-time Processing Breakthroughs</h2>
        
        <p>One of the most significant advancements has been in real-time processing capabilities. Modern object detection systems can now analyze video streams at 60+ frames per second on standard hardware, making them viable for time-sensitive applications like:</p>
        
        <ul>

      title: "The Evolution of Text-to-Speech Models",
      excerpt: "How modern TTS systems are revolutionizing accessibility and content consumption.",
      content: `
        <p>Text-to-speech (TTS) technology has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years, evolving from robotic, monotonous voices to natural-sounding speech that's increasingly difficult to distinguish from human narration. This evolution is changing how we interact with technology and consume content.</p>
        
        <h2>From Rule-Based Systems to Neural Networks</h2>
        
        <p>The journey of TTS technology spans several distinct generations:</p>
        
        <h3>First Generation: Concatenative Synthesis</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Recording large databases of speech fragments from human speakers</li>
          <li>Splitting these recordings into individual phones, diphones, or words</li>
          <li>Recombining these fragments to create new utterances</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>While this approach produced relatively natural-sounding speech for prepared phrases, it struggled with flexibility and required enormous storage for high-quality output.</p>
        
        <h3>Second Generation: Parametric Synthesis</h3>
        
        <p>The next evolution used parametric models that:</p>
